# Workout Recommendation System

A workout recommendation system that uses fuzzy logic to provide personalized exercise plans based on individual metrics like BMI, heart rate, and age.

## 🌟 Features

- **Personalized Workout Plans**: Get customized workout recommendations based on:
  - BMI (Body Mass Index)
  - Heart Rate
  - Age

- **Intelligent Recommendations**: 
  - Workout Type (Yoga, Cardio, Strength Training, HIIT)
  - Workout Intensity
  - Caloric Burn Targets
  - Rest Period Recommendations

- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - 3D Surface Plots for Fuzzy Logic Variables
  - Workout Type Distribution Visualization
  - Interactive Performance Metrics

- **Performance Analytics**:
  - Model Accuracy Metrics
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error) Analysis
  - Normalized Performance Indicators

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Python
  - Flask
  - Scikit-fuzzy
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML/CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Plotly.js
  - Font Awesome

## 📊 Dataset

The system uses the Gym Members Exercise Dataset, which contains comprehensive workout data including:
- Exercise patterns
- Physiological metrics
- Workout outcomes
- Performance indicators


## 💡 How It Works

1. **Input Processing**:
   - User enters their BMI, heart rate, and age
   - System validates and processes the input

2. **Fuzzy Logic System**:
   - Processes inputs through membership functions
   - Applies fuzzy rules for workout determination
   - Defuzzifies outputs for concrete recommendations

3. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Determines optimal workout type
   - Calculates intensity levels
   - Suggests caloric burn targets
   - Recommends rest periods

4. **Visualization**:
   - Generates 3D interactive plots
   - Shows relationship between inputs and outputs
   - Visualizes workout type distributions

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Personal trainers designing client programs
- Fitness enthusiasts seeking workout guidance
- Gym members planning exercise routines
- Health professionals recommending activity levels

## 📈 Performance

The system demonstrates robust performance with:
- High accuracy in workout type recommendations
- Low mean squared error in intensity predictions
- Reliable caloric burn estimations
